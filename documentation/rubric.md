A generic checklist for HTML, CSS and Javascript best practices is given below. 


* <u>HTML Checklist:</u> Does the code adhere to <u>HTML best practices</u> including:

  * Separates Javascript/CSS code from HTML (no inline styling)

  * `<script>` tags always occur at the bottom of the document

  * `<img>` tags always include `alt` attribute and `loading="lazy"` attribute

  * Includes a `<title>` 

  * `<input>` tags always contain a `title` attribute that describe the input pattern required.

  * Hierarchy is implied using appropriate tags: `<h1>,<h2>,<h3>` etc.

  * `<meta>` tag is used for responsive rendering.

  * Document type (i.e. `<!DOCTYPE html>` ) and language (.e.g `<html lang="en">` ) are both specified 

  * Avoids style tags, such as `<i>` and `<b>`

  * Code is commented and properly formatted for readability

    

* <u>CSS Checklist:</u> Does the code adhere to <u>CSS best practices</u> including:

  * Style is never defined inline; style sheets are contained in separate `.css` documents.

  * All text formatting is handled with CSS

  * Use of color codes in HEX, instead of color names (e.g. `red`,`blue`, etc.)

  * Use of relative units (`%`) instead of absolute (`px`) for sizing.

  * Style definitions are associated with classes or ids, not tags (e.g. `<div>`, `<p>` ,`<a>`)

  * Files names reflect their purpose (e.g. `navigation-style.css`, not `style.css`)

  * CSS is commented, and properly formatted for readability

  * Variables are used, when appropriate.

  * Style accommodates viewing content on multiple devices (e.g. both phones and desktops)

  * Follows a CSS methodology: BEM, ITCSS, or OOCSS

    

* <u>Javascript Checklist:</u> Does the code adhere to <u>Javascript best practices</u> including: 

  * Uses Function expressions and Function Declarations appropriately; unless the javascript function need to be [hoisted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting), it should be an expression, not a function.
  * Code is well commented, structured, and easy to follow
  * Functions and variables are named to reflect what they do or contain (i.e. not `func_1()`)
  * Appropriate us of constants (i.e. `const`) 
  * Use `===` operator for logical comparisons; this checks for both value and type.
  * Variable declarations should always be initialized, not undefined
  * Understand the difference between when to use `for…in` and `for…of`
  * Always add semicolons. to indicate line termination
  * Use regex when manipulating strings
